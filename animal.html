<h1>How Animals use Signals</h1>


<h2>Dogs/Wolves</h2>

    <p>
            <b>Dogs and wolves alike use signals in many ways. A wolf having their tail up, means that the are asserting 
        dominance within the pack and/or are challenging the alpha. On the other hand, having their tail down or
        tucked in between their legs in a sign of surrender. Another thing wolves are know for is howling. Howling 
        is a way wolves assemble the pack together. Dogs, their domesticated counterpart, can be trained to respond
        to signals given by humans. They can be trained to roll over, jump, sit, follow their owner and even can be 
        medical or service dogs.

<h2>Bees</h2>

    <p>
        Bees use signals to communicate where food is. They communicate this by doing special dances. One dance that
        bees perform is called the waggle dance. The wangle dance usually performed by honeybees indicates, where the
        food is. The direction of the waggle conveys the direction of the food sorce and the speed and duration conveys
        the distance and the quallity.

        <h2>Elephants</h2>
            Elephants are another animal that uses signals. They use them mainly for communication, as their territories 
            can span much over a million square acers. The main way they send each other signals is by using their trunks,
            which can be heard from as far as six miles. For farther signals though, an elephant can stomp their feet into 
            the ground to send out a low frequency vibration that can be picked up by other elephants. An elephants stomp
            can go as far as twenty miles.

    <h2>Meercats</h2>
    <p>
        A meercats main use of signals is to warn other meercats in the clan of danger. Meercats even have different types
        of calls for different threats. For instance if their is an attack from above by a bird a meercat might make a
        high pitched sound, but if threatened by a jackel or a snake, might emit a lower pitched one. They even have a
        special click noise symbolizing the all clear when the threat is gone.

    <h2>Dolphines and Whales</h2>

    <p>
        Signals are not just limited to to land animals. Sea creatures use them all the time too. Take dolpines or whales
        as an example. Dolphines use a series of clicks and whistles to communicate and each dolphine is even givin their 
        own didtict name. They also use echoloction to locate prey when its dark. Whales also use signals to communicate.
        Humpback whales have their own songs which can reach others up to 500 miles away. They too use echolocation to find
        prey. Sperm whales also use a click sound to communicate. Their clicks are so loud that they can reach up to 230 
        decibells. Thats as loud as a jet engine.
