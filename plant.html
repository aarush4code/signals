<h1>Plants and Signals</h1>

<h2>Venus fly taps</h2>
<p>
    Venus fly traps use signals to sense when an objest falls indide its mouth/hinge. A fly is first
    lured into its mouth because of the sticky sweet substince inside. The inside of the mouth is
    lined with small trigger hairs, and once an object toches one of them it closes. This would
    normally be a problem as any peice of debrie could fall inside, but the trap requires the object
    to toch 2 hairswithin thirty seconds for it to close. 
</p>



<h2>Mimosa Pudica</h2>
<p>
A Mimosa Pudica or a "Sensitive Plant" is another plant that uses signals. It uses signals to find out 
when an object touches it, or its leaves and will then curl up, and fold them in. It does this to mainly
scare off any animals that might try to eat it, and to dislodge insects.

    <h2>Acacia Tree</h2>

    <p>
        The Acacia Tree uses signals in a very special way. When the tree detects it is being eaten. It
        sends out ethylene gan into the air. The gas is then carried by the wind and eventually picked
        up by the other trees in the area. Once the signal is recived, the plants increase the amount of
        tannin in their leaves. Tannin is what makes the leaves biter and will make it lless desirable
        for the herbivor.   
    </p>

    <h2>Tomato Plants</h2>

    <p>
        Similarly to the Acacia Tree A Tomato plant can detect when being eaten by an insect, by detecting
        its saliva. It then starts producing jasmonic acid a hormone which makes the plant less digestable
        for the insect. It will also release VOCs into the air and the VOCs can also be picked up by 
        neihboring tomato plants.
