<h1>Signals in the past</h1>



    <h2>Smoke Signals</h2>

    <p>Native americans used smoke signals to cummunicate long distances across the great plains.
       They signalled this way to mainly warn others of a threat. They achived this by adding thick 
       vegatation, to get thick smoke. They even had a system that conved the seriousness of the danger.
       One puff of smoke mant that they were ok, 2 puffs meant, they were ok, but expecting an attack,
       and three meant imidiate danger.
    </p>

    <h2>Torches</h2>

    <p>
        Smoke signals worked great during the day, but were hard too see at night. Thats why people used 
        torches to communitcate after dark. They mainly used them on forts to send pre decided messages 
        down to the people on the ground. One torch might be signalling the all clear, two might signal 
        that they were enemies approching, and waving torches might signal that they were under an attack.

    <h2>Whistles</h2>

    <p>
        Near Spain, people used to use whitles to communicate overlong distances,and some whitles can go
        as far as 3 miles. The terrain there is very hilly and has mountains so whitsles are a great way 
        to communicate. The whistles can even signal specific messages, as its closly related to the
        language their. Some schools in Spain still teach the language to keep the tradition alive.

    <h2>Drums and Other Muscial Instruments</h2>
    <p>
    In central or West Africa people used to use drums to communicate from town to town. Drums were a large
    part of their culture, so it was very common to use one. The rhythms played by the drums represtented 
    words of their language, so a highlly skilled drummer could send entire sentences across. Other instruments
    such as trumpets were used in war to send messages across the battle field. The messages that were sent were
    normally battle commands telling soilders to attack or retreat.

    <h2>Cave Paintings</h2>
    <p>
        During the Paleolithic era people painted images on walls to represent different things. These drawings have
        been found all over the world in places like Spain and France. They painted these sybols with their hands on
        cave walls and it usually represtentedthings such as hunting information and it also marked down territories
        for their group.
