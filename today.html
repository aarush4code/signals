    <h1>Signals Today</h1>

    <h2>Football Call Signs</h2>
    <p>
      In lots of sports, not just football, a team has call signs that symbolise their strategy for the play. 
      These signs are usually signaled to the player before the play and in breaks between the game. these
      call signs can be verbal, like, "Blue42", "Omaha", and "Green 18". But can also be actions that the
      QB or the coach does to his players like the QB taping his helmet or lifting his leg.
    </p>

     <h2>Ref's Whistle</h2> 

     <p>
      In mostly team sports, the ref will blow a whistle to signal for breaks and the end of a game. This
      is pretty iconic as refs have been whistling since the games were invented. The whistle they use 
      is important because if it isn't loud enough players might not be able to here it over the noisy
      crowd.

    <h2>Taffic Lights</h2>

        <p>
            Traffic lights are essential to our every day life as they make sure everyone is safe on the road,
            without them they would be way to many accidents and every turn would be a hazard. Ther're three 
            colors on the light, red on the very top, signals for the drivers to stop. Green In the middle
            tells them to go and yellow tells them to slow down.
        </p>

    <h2>T.V Remote</h2>
   
    <p>
        T.V remotes let us "talk" to the T.V by sending infared rays towards the T.V. The T.V then picks up these
        rays. Each button on the remote has a different infared ray, so the T.V knows whether it should lower
        or if it should higher the volume.  Some of the newer remotes use radio frequency instead, which lets
        the remote us bluetooth or wifi to connect instead. The bennifit of using this is that it will still
        work if something is between it and the T.V.
     </p>   

     <h2>Emergency Sirens</h2>
     <p>
        To get an urgent message to many people quickly, the police might use an emergency signal to get their attention.
        These signals can be for many things, like a police or ambulence siren, a tornado, flood and can even signal for
        a missing child. Police and ambulence sirens are mainly used on the road to get people to clear. Flood, tornado
        and a missing child alert, or a amber alert is a message sent to everybodies phone and flood and tornado sirens 
        are also played on loud speakers.
