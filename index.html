    <h1>Signals</h1>

    <h2>What is a Signal</h2>

    <p>
        A signal can be anything from a high 5 to a call sign in football. It can even be a smoke sign.<br />
        They are a way of sending a message, which can be as specific or broad as you want. Overall,<br />
        signals are a way to tell someone or something information, and are essential to our every <br />
        day life.
    </p>

    <h2>Animals using signals</h2>
    <p>
        Humans aren't the only species who use signals. Animals use them all the time too. They use<br />
        them in a similar fashion to communicate a wide variety of subjects. For example, they can<br />
        use signals to communicate, find food and warn others of danger.

    <h2>Plants and signals</h2>
    <p>
        Plants also use signals, though they use them very differently than humans and animals do. They<br />
        use signals to communicate with their roots and some types of plants even react in a certain<br />
        way when provoked.
