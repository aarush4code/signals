    <h1>Signals</h1>

    <h2>What is a Signal</h2>

    <p>
        A signal can be anything from a high 5 to a call sign in football. It can even be a smoke sign.
        They are a way of sending a message, which can be as specific or broad as you want. Overall,
        signals are a way to tell someone or something information, and are essential to our every 
        day life.

    <h2>Signals from the past</h2>

    People have been using signals since they lived in caves. Earlier the signals they used were very
    simple, and only communicated basic nessecities, such as food, danger, shelter, cordinating a location,
    or even social bonding.<br>

    <h2>Signals Today</h2>
    <p>
        Today the main way people use signals is with technology, but other non-technichal signals are still
        commonly used. The most common signals still convey the same messages that signals 30,000-40,000 years
        ago did.

    <h2>Animals and Signals</h2>
    <p>
        Humans aren't the only species who use signals. Animals use them all the time too. They use
        them in a similar fashion to communicate a wide variety of subjects. For example, they can
        use signals to communicate, find food and warn others of danger.<br>

    <h2>Plants and Signals</h2>
    <p>
        Plants also use signals, though they use them very differently than humans and animals do. They
        use signals to communicate with their roots and some types of plants even react in a certain
        way when provoked.<br>
